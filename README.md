##Find first career goals for/against

This repository contains five (so far) scripts. When sourced in combination (getfirstgoals.R must be sourced last),   
a dataframe will be produced that contains each player that scored their first career goal in the seasons since 2009.

At this point, no code is included for generating plots, though I intend to write a  Shiny implementation of this 
project.

This project was initially done before I was introduced to github, hence the lack of version control  early on. 
Newer versions of code will adhere to common style guide recommendations (variables will be named more properly).
