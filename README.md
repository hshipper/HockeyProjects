# HockeyProjects

## Update

This project is no longer in the works, as it turns out that crawling sports-reference pages is against their TOS and will result in IP bans. As a result I can't recommend that anybody try to actually use this.

## Find first career goals for/against

This repository contains five (so far) scripts. When sourced in combination (getfirstgoals.R must be sourced last),   
a dataframe will be produced that contains each player that scored their first career goal in the seasons since 2009. This is being generated as an R Studio project, hence the .Rproj file and packrat directory.

At this point, no code is included for generating plots, though I intend to write a  Shiny implementation of this 
project.

This project was initially done before I was introduced to github, hence the lack of version control  early on. 
Newer versions of code will adhere to common style guide recommendations (variables will be named more properly).
